# 📝 To-Do List (HTML + CSS)

A clean, minimal, and fully responsive **To-Do List interface** built using **pure HTML and CSS**.  
This project focuses on practicing front-end layout design, modern UI styling, and clean code structure — without any JavaScript functionality.

## 📖 Overview

This project represents my first hands-on practice in creating a complete web component using only **HTML and CSS**.  
The goal was to understand **visual hierarchy, spacing, alignment**, and **consistent styling** — all key aspects of front-end design.
